# MoviePosterGenerator

This script creates posters from a movie file. To do this it takes the average color of a frame every second.
This data can then be processed in the three functions create_line_poster, create_wave_poster and create_average poster.
Just play around with the variables until you get a result you like, since every color sets needs some different constants.

Examples from the movie the End of Evangelion:
